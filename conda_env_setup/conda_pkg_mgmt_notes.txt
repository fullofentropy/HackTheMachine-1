Instructions for installing packages from requirements text file into a new environment on personal device

1) Open Anaconda Prompt (Type into search bar for Windows, may need to open as administrator)

2) Grab the spec-file_htm21.txt and put it somewhere (we will reference its location later)

3) Here comes the sweetest looking bit of code you'll see from conda. This line will install all the packages in the spec0file_htm21.txt into a new environemnt that you specify 

# General Example: 
conda create --name myenv --file path/where/file/is/spec-file_htm21.txt

# Actual Example: 
conda create --name test21 --file C:/Users/relat/OneDrive/Desktop/spec-file_htm21.txt

3a) Activate the environment and check out what packages are in it:
conda activate myenv
conda list

4) That should do the trick. All the packages have been updated for python 3.8. Beyond standard packages added: gensim, spacy, xgboost, tabulate, shap, lime, graphviz, treeviz, fiscalyear, dtreeviz, tensorflow, keras 

5) Here are some useful conda code lines
# Delete an environment
conda env remove -n myenv
# Create an environment 
conda create -n myenv
# Activate an environemnt 
conda activate test-env
# create a list of packages and put in a specific path
conda list --explicit > path/spec-file.txt



6) Useful website for environmental management: 
# https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#cloning-an-environment

7) General Package management notes:
# So if you need to install more packages and want consistent packagement management without having to deal with a .yml files, one user can download the pckgs and update the spec-file.txt, share the spec-file.txt with others
# run the following line of code to update an existing env with the new spec-file.txt:
conda install --name myenv --file path/spec-file.txt
# Conda does not check architecture or dependencies when installing from a spec file. To ensure that the packages work correctly, make sure that the file was created from a working environment, and use it on the same architecture, operating system, and platform, such as linux-64 or osx-64.
