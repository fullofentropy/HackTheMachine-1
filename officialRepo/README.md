<h2> Welcome to Hack the Machine! </h2>

Data and documentation for all three challenges can be found in their respective folders. It is highly advised that participants perform the following actions:

  * Commit CSVs to each challenge submission folder early/often to ensure you have a valid submission ready (we will only grade the last submission before a deadline so you can commit to the submission folders as often as you want)
  * Read through all the documents prior to starting a challenge
  * Use the zoom and/or slack channels if you have questions

<h3> About the files/folders in this repo </h3>

  * Challenge1, Challenge2, Challenge3 folders - The challenge folders where you will find a readme as well as a data and submission folder
  * Submission\VerificationOverview.docx - how to use GitHub Actions to validate your challenge submissions
  * .github folder - contains validation scripts that run automatically when you make commits to the main branch of this repo


Also, if you're new to GitHub please find good starting tutorials for adding files to your repository here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#commit

<h3> A note about the .github folder: </h3>

<b> PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES TO THE .GITHUB DIRECTORY OR ANY OF ITS SUBDIRECTORIES </b>

The .github folder contains a workflows folder that performs the "challenge validation actions" that let you see if your submission is in a valid format. Please don't delete/add/modify any files to this folder or the contained workflows subfolder. Also note that changing any of the files in this directory do not give you any advantage as we perform actual grading in a completely separate space.
