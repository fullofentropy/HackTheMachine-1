    "Skillfully allocating medical resources during a pandemic can save lives. Unexpected and extreme medical events not only disrupt hospitals' normal routines and protocol, but strain resources such as trained staff, space and pharmaceuticals, in addition to PPE and life-saving medical equipment. Determining how to most effectively allocate these resources is paramount to assuring the wellbeing of Sailors far from port.\n",

    "In this scenario, you will oversee the medical bay of the USS GHOST where COVID-19 has taken hold of the crew. Your task is to create an algorithm to deploy the ship's available resources in a manner that will ensure as many Sailors as possible recover from the virus."
